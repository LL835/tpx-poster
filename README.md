The original poster is [reference-image.jpg](https://ll835.github.io/tpx-poster/reference-image.jpg), and my attempt at recreating it can be found [here](https://ll835.github.io/tpx-poster/).

To view files locally, clone the repo onto your machine by:

- Opening the terminal and navigating to the desired directory.
